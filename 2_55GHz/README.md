# 2.55 GHz Measurement Campaign

This dataset contains measured time-variant channel transfer functions of the indoor channel sounding measurement campaign at 2.55GHz center frequency.
Measurements have been conducted at 126 different positions of the rotary unit on the sliding board and for 8 different transmitter's velocities. 
Different positions (7 positions of X-axis and 18 positions of Y-axis) of the rotary unit are mutually separated by 0.4 wavelength. 
Furthermore, measurements have been conducted for transmitter's velocites of 20, 40, 60, 100, 120, 150 and 200 km/h.
